# CyberThreat-Detecton

The increasing sophistication of cyberattacks has highlighted the need for automated, efficient cyber-threat detection techniques. In this project, an AI-based solution is proposed that utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to detect cyber threats. The approach preprocesses raw security events into structured event profiles, capturing key features that are then analyzed by the LSTM model, which excels at handling sequential data. Using the CICIDS2018 dataset for experimentation, the system improves detection accuracy by reducing false positives and enhancing true positive alerts, providing security analysts with actionable insights. The results demonstrate that the LSTM model outperforms traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, showcasing superior performance in both accuracy and false positive reduction. This work highlights the potential of LSTM for real-world cybersecurity applications, emphasizing its effectiveness in building scalable, automated network intrusion detection systems.
